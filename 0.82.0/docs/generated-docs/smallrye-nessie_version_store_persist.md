| Property | Default Value | Type | Description |
|----------|---------------|------|-------------|
| `nessie.version.store.persist.repository-id` | (empty) | `String` | Nessie repository ID (optional) that identifies a particular Nessie storage repository. <br><br>When remote (shared) database is used, multiple Nessie repositories may co-exist in the same  database (and in the same schema). In that case this configuration parameter can be used to  distinguish those repositories.  |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.commit-retries` | `2147483647` | `int` | maximum retries for CAS-like operations. Used when committing to Nessie, when the HEAD (or tip)  of a branch changed during the commit, this value defines the maximum number of retries.  Default means unlimited. <br><br>See: #retryMaxSleepMillis() |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.commit-timeout-millis` | `5000` | `long` | Timeout for CAS-like operations in milliseconds. <br><br>See: #retryMaxSleepMillis() |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.retry-initial-sleep-millis-lower` | `5` | `long` | When the commit logic has to retry an operation due to a concurrent, conflicting update to the  database state, usually a concurrent change to a branch HEAD, this parameter defines the  _initial_ _lower_ bound of the exponential backoff.  <br><br>See: #retryMaxSleepMillis() |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.retry-initial-sleep-millis-upper` | `25` | `long` | When the commit logic has to retry an operation due to a concurrent, conflicting update to the  database state, usually a concurrent change to a branch HEAD, this parameter defines the  _initial_ _upper_ bound of the exponential backoff.  <br><br>See: #retryMaxSleepMillis() |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.retry-max-sleep-millis` | `250` | `long` | When the commit logic has to retry an operation due to a concurrent, conflicting update to the  database state, usually a concurrent change to a branch HEAD, this parameter defines the  _maximum_ sleep time.  Each retry doubles the lower and upper bounds of the random sleep  time, unless the doubled upper bound would exceed the value of this configuration property. <br><br>See: #retryInitialSleepMillisUpper() |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.parents-per-commit` | `20` | `int` | Number of parent-commit-hashes stored in each commit. This is used to allow bulk-fetches when  accessing the commit log.  |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.max-serialized-index-size` | `204800` | `int` | The maximum allowed serialized size of the content index structure in a _reference  index_ segment.  This value is used to determine, when elements in a reference index segment  need to be split.   <br><br>Note: this value _must_ be smaller than a database's _hard item/row size  limit_. |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.max-incremental-index-size` | `51200` | `int` | The maximum allowed serialized size of the content index structure in a _Nessie commit_,  called _incremental index_. This value is used to determine, when elements in an  incremental index, which were kept from previous commits, need to be pushed to a new or updated  _reference index_.   <br><br>Note: this value _must_ be smaller than a database's _hard item/row size  limit_. |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.max-reference-stripes-per-commit` | `50` | `int` | Maximum number of referenced index objects stored inside commit objects. <br><br>If the external reference index for this commit consists of up to this amount of stripes,  the references to the stripes will be stored inside the commit object. If there are more than  this amount of stripes, an external _index segment_ will be created instead.  |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.assumed-wall-clock-drift-micros` | `5000000` | `long` | Assumed wall-clock drift between multiple Nessie instances in microseconds.  |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.namespace-validation` | `true` | `boolean` | Whether namespace validation is enabled, changing this to false will break the Nessie  specification!  <br><br>Committing operations by default enforce that all (parent) namespaces exist.   <br><br>This configuration setting is only present for a few Nessie releases to work around  potential migration issues and is subject to removal. <br><br>Since: 0.52.0<br><br>_Deprecated_ This setting will be removed. |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.ref-previous-head-count` | `20` | `int` | Named references keep a history of up to this amount of previous HEAD pointers, and up to the  configured age.   |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.ref-previous-head-time-span-seconds` | `300` | `long` | Named references keep a history of previous HEAD pointers with this age in seconds, and up to  the configured amount.   |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.cache-capacity-mb` |  | `int` | Fixed amount of heap used to cache objects, set to 0 to disable the cache entirely. Must not be  used with fractional cache sizing. See description for `cache-capacity-fraction-of-heap` for the default value.  |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.cache-capacity-fraction-min-size-mb` |  | `int` | When using fractional cache sizing, this amount in MB is the minimum cache size.  |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.cache-capacity-fraction-of-heap` |  | `double` | Fraction of Javaâ€™s max heap size to use for cache objects, set to 0 to disable. Must not be  used with fixed cache sizing. If neither this value nor a fixed size is configured, a default  of .7 (70%) is assumed.  |
| `nessie.version.store.persist.cache-capacity-fraction-adjust-mb` |  | `int` | When using fractional cache sizing, this amount in MB of the heap will always be "kept free"  when calculating the cache size.   |
